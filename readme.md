## DEV posts

This is a repo to store images/gifs/videos for DEV posts that are too big to embed directly.

Realised this is not going to work either, needs to be 25MB or below for gifs. Tried doing it with <25MB gif, but still doesn't upload into DEV.

DEV posts need to be <10MB. Keeping this here so I remember :smile:
